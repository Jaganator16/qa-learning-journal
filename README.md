# QA Learning Journal

This repository documents my learning journey into software testing, focusing on clear test thinking, execution, and communication.

The goal is to build strong fundamentals first (manual testing, test design, bug reporting) and then progress into API testing and automation.

## How this repository is structured

- Each **week** has its own folder
- Each week contains:
  - `notes.md` — what I learned and reflected on
  - `examples.md` — test ideas, executed tests, and bug reports
  - `screenshots/` — evidence for executed tests or bugs (when applicable)

## Workflow I follow

1. Write test ideas for a real feature or page
2. Refine tests for clarity and observable outcomes
3. Execute a small subset and record PASS / FAIL
4. Write bug reports for unexpected behaviour
5. Reflect on what I learned and improve next time

## Weeks

- [Week 1 — Foundations](week-1-foundations/)
  - [Notes](week-1-foundations/notes.md)
  - [Examples](week-1-foundations/examples.md)
  - [Screenshots](week-1-foundations/screenshots/)

## Book study

Alongside hands-on practice, I’m studying classic software testing literature and documenting my learning and exercises.

- **Software Testing Techniques — Boris Beizer**
  - Progress, chapter notes, and exercises logged in:
    - `book-notes/beizer-software-testing-techniques/`

## Tools & focus areas
- Manual testing
- Test design & coverage
- Bug reporting
- GitHub documentation
- (Later) API testing and automation
