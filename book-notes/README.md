# Book notes

This section contains reading notes, reflections, and progress logs for software testing books studied as part of my QA learning.

The focus is on understanding concepts over time rather than producing polished summaries. Notes reflect how I engage with the material, what I learn, and how my understanding develops.

## Structure

- **istqb-foundation/**
  Notes and progress for the ISTQB Foundation syllabus.
  - [chapter-notes/](istqb-foundation/chapter-notes) — Notes and reflections per chapter or section
  - [reading-log.md](istqb-foundation/reading-log.md) — Reading progress and key takeaways

- **beizer-software-testing-techniques/**
  Notes related to *Software Testing Techniques* by Boris Beizer.
  - [chapter-notes/](beizer-software-testing-techniques/chapter-notes) — Chapter-based notes and reflections
  - [reading-log.md](beizer-software-testing-techniques/reading-log.md) — Reading progress and observations

## How I use these notes

- Chapter notes capture understanding, questions, and learning points rather than textbook summaries
- Reading logs track progress and high-level insights
- Notes are written incrementally and may be revisited as understanding improves

These notes are part of an ongoing learning journal and are not intended to be exhaustive or final interpretations of the material.
