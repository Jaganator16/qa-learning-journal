## Software development models

### Waterfall model

Stages:

- Requirements specification
- Functional specification
- Technical specification
- Program specification
- Coding
- Test

Each work product is completed before moving on to the next stage.  
Testing is carried out once the code has been fully developed.

What is needed is a process that assures quality at every stage of the lifecycle.

Checks throughout the lifecycle include verification and validation (V&V):

- **Verification** — checks that the work product meets its specified requirements.
- **Validation** — evaluates the work product against user needs (e.g. whether both novice and experienced users can use it effectively).

The V-model is an extension of the waterfall model.

Cyclical models, often referred to as iterative models, allow the coding stage to begin once initial user needs have been captured.
