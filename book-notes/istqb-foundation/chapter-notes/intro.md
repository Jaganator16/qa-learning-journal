# Introduction

Reading the introduction helped me understand how the book is intended to be used. It made it clear that this isn’t something to read passively from start to finish, but a learning aid to support building understanding over time.

The book explains that Chapters 1–6 don’t need to be worked through strictly in order, which helped me decide to skim the starts of each chapter first and then work through them based on where my knowledge feels weakest. I plan to leave Chapter 7 until the end, once I have more context from the earlier chapters.

This gave me a clearer structure for how I’ll work with the material, rather than defaulting to a linear approach without thinking about whether it suits my learning needs.
