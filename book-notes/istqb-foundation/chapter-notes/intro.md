# Introduction

Reading the introduction helped me understand how the book is intended to be used. It made it clear that this isn’t something to read passively from start to finish, but a learning aid to support building understanding over time.

The book explains that Chapters 1–6 don’t need to be worked through strictly in order, which helped me decide to skim the starts of each chapter first and then work through them based on where my knowledge feels weakest. I plan to leave Chapter 7 until the end, once I have more context from the earlier chapters.

This gave me a clearer structure for how I’ll work with the material, rather than defaulting to a linear approach without thinking about whether it suits my learning needs.

## Levels of understanding

- **K1 — Recall:** Remember information without necessarily applying it
- **K2 — Explain:** Explain concepts, classify information, or make comparisons
- **K3 — Apply:** Apply knowledge in a practical setting
- **K4 — Analyse:** Analyse situations to determine appropriate actions

## Chapter overview (intro skim)

1. **Fundamentals of testing**  
   Introduces core testing concepts, establishes the structure of the book, and provides context for later chapters.

2. **Life cycles**  
   Covers testing within the software development lifecycle, including work products, sequential and iterative models, and testing activities across development stages.

3. **Static testing**  
   Introduces techniques that assess artefacts without executing software, enabling earlier defect detection through reviews and inspections.

4. **Test design techniques**  
   Covers specification-based, structure-based, and experience-based test design techniques, including examples. Structure-based techniques extend beyond the Foundation syllabus into code analysis concepts.

5. **Test management**  
   Provides an overview of how testing is organised and managed, including risk, planning, control, independence, and testing roles.

6. **Tool support for testing**  
   Discusses types of testing tools, their benefits and risks, and considerations when introducing tools into an organisation.

7. **The examination**  
   Explains exam structure, weighting, learning objectives, and question distribution.

## Planned reading order

Based on the chapter skims, I plan to read the book in the following order: **1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4**.

This prioritises foundational concepts, lifecycle context, roles, and tooling before moving into static testing and detailed test design techniques.
